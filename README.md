# Reader-Writer-Problem
I simulated reader writer problem in operating system using python. 
This repository contains a simulation of the classic reader-writer problem in operating systems, implemented using Python and the Streamlit library. The reader-writer problem is a synchronization problem where multiple processes contend for access to a shared resource, with different behaviors for readers and writers. In this simulation, you can explore how readers and writers interact with the shared resource, showcasing various synchronization techniques and their effects on system performance.
**To run the file final.py, after running the code write streamlit run final.py in the terminal window.It will directly lead you to the simulation page.**
